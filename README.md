# Parchment Shell

This is a game-management shell for Parchment. It provides a simple sidebar to which you can add mulitple interactive fiction games and switch between them at will. When coupled with htappen's [Parchment](https://github.com/htappen/parchment/branches/master) fork, it will also save all of your game states in your browser, allowing you to resume even between browser sessions.

## Use it Online

I have a copy hosted at http://if.sitosis.com that you can use. To add a game, click the "Add Game" button on the sidebar. There is now a built-in search index that allows you to easily find and add any playable game in the [IFDB](http://ifdb.tads.org). You can add as many games as you want, and click them in the sidebar to switch between them.

## Download

I have packaged the shell up with a copy of htappen's fork at http://if.sitosis.com/ifplayer.zip that you can run from your hard drive. Just download it, unzip, and open up index.html in your browser.
